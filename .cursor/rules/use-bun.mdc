# Use Bun Package Manager

**Always use Bun instead of npm for package management.**

## Commands

- ✅ Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- ✅ Use `bun add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`
- ✅ Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
- ✅ Use `bunx` instead of `npx` when available
- ❌ Never use `npm install`, `npm run`, or `npx` directly

## Portability

The project should remain portable and work with npm if needed:
- Package.json scripts should work with both `bun run` and `npm run`
- Lock files: Use `bun.lockb` as primary, but ensure `package.json` is compatible
- When suggesting commands, always show the Bun version first

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
bun install
bun add react
bun run dev
bunx create-vite

# ❌ INCORRECT
npm install
npm install react
npm run dev
npx create-vite
```
